Added files required for compiling.  You'll still need to add ofx3DmodelLoader and ofxMultiTouchPad addons for compilation.

===================================================================================================

Current controls:

w,s -> Move actuator up/down
a,d -> Move actuator left/right
q,e -> Move actuator forward/back

t,g -> change stepper0 angle
y,h -> change stepper1 angle
u,j -> change stepper2 angle

p   -> toggle point cloud (possible servo location generated)
[   -> toggle point cloud (cartesian generated)
o   -> run genetic algorithm calculation (only runs a ga against the Himmelblau equation for now)
k   -> toggle between showing the delta robot and the visualisation of the search space
l   -> run the search space brute force generation algorithm (to give crude visualisation of search space)

[space] -> toggle 3D tumbling

z,x -> change ratio of effector side length to base side length
c,v -> change ratio of effector side length to upper arm length
b,n -> change ratio of effector side length to lower arm length
